# MojoFit
Get your Mojo Workin'! Gamified Fitness with Friends.

I am learning mobile app development in my spare time and this is my first attempt at an application that I plan to publish. 

Currently working on Android version and utilizing Google Fit APIs.

The idea for the app is an RPG like fitness app with a customizable character and 4 main stats - Heart, Mind, Power, and Speed. Different activities affect different stats. Running or walking affect Heart and Mind, Weight lifting or calestenics affect Power, Intervals affect Speed, Meditation affects Mind... you get the idea. As you complete activities, Experience points are earned and Loot is acquired which can then be equiped on the character if the right level and stats have been achieved. Loot can be different outfits, armor, accessories, weapons, hairstyles, character poses, emotes, or currency.

Connect with friends who are also active and each of the friends gets an XP Bonus during the activity allowing everyone to level up faster (The Mojo is workin'!). App will tag friends as active during activites and alert users if desired. Also allow users to send quick messages to encourage friends to workout with them. Another idea is to utilize Bluetooth Low Energy to detect other active MojoFit users in the immediate vicinity, such as in a group workout setting at the gym or yoga studio.

Share the customized Character on social media.
